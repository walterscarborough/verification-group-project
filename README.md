###Overview

This project was created as an experiment to test symbolic execution performance and path differences in Java and Python. We chose to test three sorting algorithms (bubble sort, quick sort and merge sort) in a range of input sizes using JPF (Java Pathfinder) and PyExZ3 (Z3 and CVC SMT solvers).


This repository contains code for our sorting algorithm implementations, symbolic execution wrappers, and instrumentation. It also contains data that we collected from running our experiments.
